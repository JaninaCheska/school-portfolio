Introduction
The Motor Taxi Service prototype is a user-centered digital solution designed to enhance the commuting experience for both passengers and drivers. This platform aims to provide a reliable, safe, and efficient transportation option, especially in urban and semi-urban areas where quick, short-distance rides are in demand. The service offers features such as real-time ride booking, driver tracking, fare estimates, and secure payment options. By addressing common issues like long wait times and lack of communication between riders and drivers, the motor taxi app seeks to improve local transportation systems and user satisfaction.
